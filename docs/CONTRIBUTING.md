## ➕ Commits
First, let's answer the questions **"When do I commit? And how many files do I commit at once?"**
<br>
The answer is very simple! Commit anytime you are done with ANY task. **For ex:**
<br>
<br>
Let's say you are adding a login page. That's a big task, so you divide it on small ***sub-tasks***. (Make a login box, make a button, connect firebase, and etc.)

Everytime you are done with a subtask, make a commit! 

> [!WARNING] 
> Please, don't stage all the files in one commit. Stage only the files that are relevant to the subtask you finished.<br>
> This is going to be unbelievably helpful down the road.

### 🗃️ Commit message Structure
---
Commits should consist of **three** parts:
```
<type> Message
<blank space>
<body>
```

### Example Commit
---
```
fix: Fixed login button bug

The bug where login button would successfully authenticate the user, but didn't take him to the homepage as needed.
```

### 📑 Commit Types
---
Is recommended to be one of the below items. Only **feat** and **fix** show up in the changelog, in addition to breaking changes (See breaking changes section below).

* **feat**: A new feature
* **fix**: A bug fix
* **docs**: Documentation only changes
* **refactor**: A code change that neither fixes a bug or adds a feature
* **test**: Adding missing tests
* **chore**: Changes to the build process or auxiliary tools and libraries such as documentation
  generation

### ❗️ Breaking Changes
---
Put any breaking changes with migration instructions in the commit body.

If there is a breaking change, put "BREAKING CHANGE:" in your ***commit body***, and it will show up in the **changelog**.

## 🌳 Branching
Try to have 1 branch per 1 issue. When you take up an issue (task) to work on, assign it to yourself on the issue's page, and comment: "@AdiKsOnDev, I am working on this issue."


The name of the branch has to be as follows:
```
<issue-number>-<branch-name>
```

### 📄 Example branch name
```
9-migrating-to-reactJS
```

## Pull Requests (PRs)
Make a pull request when you are completely done with your issue. Assign me as a reviewer & assignee, as the milestone choose the according milestone.

### 🗃️ PR message structure
---
```
<heading>
<body>
